## **FishSnapID: Fish Identification with Deep Learning for Malaysia Local Fish Market**

This project develops a mobile app for fish species identification and provides fish information. The app uses a deep learning model to accurately identify fish species from user-uploaded pictures or by taking a picture of the fish directly with the in-app camera.

## **Problem Statement**

- **Limited availability of local fish datasets for Malaysia.**
- **Challenges with distinct characteristics:** Similarity in fish characteristics.
- **Addressing Data Challenges:** Tackle varying imaging conditions, including issues with camera angles, contrast, and image quality.

## **Methods**

1. Data Collection: Collect images from Malaysian local fish markets.
2. Model Training: Use deep learning models (DenseNet121, VGG16, and MobileNetV2).
3. Testing: Test the models using a separate dataset.

## **Conclusion**

- **Project Success:** Successfully identified fish species from images obtained from local markets using three deep-learning models: DenseNet121, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
- **Model Performance:** DenseNet121 was selected for the mobile app, achieving the highest accuracy at 99.78%.
- **Mobile App Development:** Integrated DenseNet121 as the model in a user-friendly mobile app that allows for easy photo capture and upload.
- **Educational Features:** The app includes educational information and a quick reference guide about fish species and their habitats.
